## TODOS
constraint at least two requests per second as the docs state
tags blacklist add and remove commands

syntax
/lewd tags [...]  (! for blacklisting)

turret or glados appear sometimes whenever users are typing

pats, pats stats

random sticker reaction on reply
for example: reply: /fuckoff
/fuckoff!
with ! it will print some RP message in italics as well as sending the sticker.

db category should have same name as command.

save sticker set ids so that the bot will try to retrieve a matching sticker from the
category and set that was selected by the user (/useset {id} /listsets with ids). if none was found it will just send
some random one

setting feature: tag stickers as NSFW. allow users to enable/disable them

handle ONE single group in my case. (ideally group whitelist / password when invited)

hello command that sends a turret "hello" voice message
